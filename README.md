# centralized_address_book

## About the project ##
The centralized address book aims to be the single source of truth for an individual's personal contact info, especially their billing/shipping address. I aim to build a solution that will allow individuals to manage all their business relationships from a single dashboard-like UI, thus simplifying and automating the tedious work of keeping everyone up to date (for example, when they move). Businesses will also enjoy the benefits of keeping their customer addresses up to date, hopefully putting an end to lost customers due to incorrect customer info.
